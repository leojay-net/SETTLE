## THE PROBLEM: Latin America's Payment System Crisis

Financial exclusion, currency instability and high transaction costs are a major problem in latin american economies, affecting population and economic growth.

**Banking Exclusion Crisis**

According to statistics, 21% of the population is financially excluded, lacking access to banking or credit services. This issue is popular among low-income households, with only 59% of low-income citizens holding bank accounts. The problem is even more significant in rural areas, where only 40% of the population outside major cities have accounts. This exclusion creates a cycle of poverty, as individuals are unable to save money, access credit, or participate in the larger economy.

**Currency Instability & Inflation**

In Argentina, for example, hyperinflation has led many citizens to turn to more stable assets to protect their savings. Similarly, Brazil has experienced currency volatility that has impacted cross-border trade, while Venezuela's economic crisis has forced its citizens to adopt alternative payment methods. This highlights the role of inflation in the financial crisis of these countries.

**Cross-Border Payment Friction**

 Traditional payments have about 6% to 8% of the specified amount attached as fees, and can take 3-7 business days to settle. The process involves multiple intermediaries and complex clearing procedures, with different time zones and bank operating hours adding to the delays.  Each country has its own unique rules for data, anti-money laundering (AML), and sanctions screening.

**High Transaction Costs**

Within local economies, traditional payment processors typically charge 3-5% per transaction, in addition to hidden costs and currency conversion fees. These high costs disproportionately affect small businesses and consumers.

**Third-Party Custody Risks**

Relying on third parties introduces risks for merchants. These platforms hold merchant funds, exposing businesses to counterparty risk and the possibility of frozen accounts due to compliance issues. This takes control away from the merchant and creates a sticky situation for businesses that depend on steady cash flow to operate and grow.

## THE SOLUTION

A payment gateway that instantly translates between chains and tokens so customers can use whatever token they have and the merchant receives exactly what they specified. The gateway handles any necessary cross chain bridging if the merchant’s chain differs from the customers’. The seamless payment flow works as such:
- With the SETTLE API integrated into the checkout flow, the merchant can configure their desired settlement chain and token.   
- For each transaction, SETTLE generates a unique payment invoice with real-time quoted amount, specifying the exact token amount required from the customer regardless of their chain
- SETTLE’s smart routing system calculates the required amount of the chosen asset based on real-time, cross-chain pricing oracles.
- Once the customer’s transaction is confirmed on their chosen chain, the system initiates the swap and transfer of value using a secure cross-chain protocol 
- The received assets are automatically routed through liquidity pools to be converted to the merchant’s preferred asset and the merchant receives the exact amount within minutes

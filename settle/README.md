This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

### Integration Demo (Hosted Checkout flow)

- Visit `/integration-demo` to simulate a third-party app using Settle's hosted checkout.
- Clicking "Checkout with Settle" redirects to `/payment-demo` with URL params (amount, orderId, token, chain, description, redirectUrl).
- After the simulated confirmation, you'll be redirected to `/payment-success` and see details reflected from the checkout.

Environment:

- Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_SETTLE_PK` in `.env` (optional). Default is `pk_test_demo`.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
